Please include:
- Link to the library.
- License(s): PD/MIT0/0BSD/CC0 are preferred. Multi-licensed is even better.
- Kind: C, C++, or both C/C++.
- Number of files: 1 is preferred. 2 is acceptable. +3 are debatable.
- Brief description so it fits our tight table listing (ideally around 6 words max).

Remember the rules:
- Libraries must be usable from C or C++, ideally both.
- Libraries must include the licensing terms in the header and source files.
- Libraries should be usable from more than one platform (ideally, all major desktops and/or all major mobile).
- Libraries should compile and work on both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.
- Libraries should use at most two files (one header, one source): more than two files are mostly forbidden.

**Please consider postponing the PR if the submission does not guarantee most of the conditions above.**

You can also chat/discuss about C/C++ and Game development in our discord channel: https://discord.gg/2fZVEym
The server is meant to be a pleasant space to chat about C, C++, Libs authoring and Game development specifically.
