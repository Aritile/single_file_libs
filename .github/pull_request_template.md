Include the link to the library in your description, as well as in the PR itself.

Remember the rules:
- Libraries must be usable from C or C++, ideally both.
- Libraries must include the licensing terms in the header and source files.
- Libraries should be usable from more than one platform (ideally, all major desktops and/or all major mobile).
- Libraries should compile and work on both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.
- Libraries should use at most two files (one header, one source): more than two files are mostly forbidden.

Please consider postponing the PR if the submission does not guarantee most of the conditions above.
